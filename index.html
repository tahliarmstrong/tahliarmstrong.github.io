        <b>My name is Tahlia Armstrong. Welcome to my portfolio website.</b>

<p>I am an 18 year old design student in my first year of studies at Massey University, specifically at the Wellington campus. I’m working my way towards a Bachelor of Design with Honours.</p>

<p>Moving to Wellington was a big change for me, as I have grown up in Tauranga mostly, but have spent a few of my childhood years living in Hamilton and also Brisbane, Australia. I love living very central in the city, but nothing compares to home.</p>

<p>Design has always been a passion of mine, as well as a few other art forms such as photography, sketching, and painting. I have a lot of experience with design and painting particularly, as these were subjects I took during high school, which I loved. I continue to explore and learn new things about design every day.</p> 

<p><i>“There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder.”</i></p></div>
